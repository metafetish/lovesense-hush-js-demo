# Lovesense Hush JS Demo

**DEPRECATED** - Work now happening at [buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io)

Quick demo of Lovesense Buttplug control using WebBluetooth on Chrome.
Requires Chrome 56 with Experimental Web Extensions turned on. Only
works on mac/linux currently.

Also, expect things to be kinda slow. Each message takes like,
75-100ms roundtrip, and are queued. So things may lag some.
